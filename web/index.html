Snad Stack
Just a browser demo, expect bugs
Meant to run as native executable

CONTROLS
left click = place selection
scroll = resize selection
resize window = expand environment
keyboard = change selected powder

a = air / delete 
g = gas
w = water
s = sand
r = rock
c = cloner
f = fire
p = planks
o = oil
l = lava

Particles can interact
Like fire burn oils
Water + Lava = Stone

The rest is for you to find out ;)
