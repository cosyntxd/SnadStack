Inspired by many of the online falling sand games from the early 2000's, I decided to start making my own in rust. Of course it will not be a fully-fledged out game because this is my first large project in Rust, but I will to make a fully cross platform falling snad engine. There will be some influence from games such as [Powder-Toy](https://github.com/The-Powder-Toy/The-Powder-Toy) and [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/)
